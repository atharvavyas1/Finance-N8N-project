Watch the video above to hear more top stock picks and key investment themes. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination Overtime . Video Transcript 00:00 Speaker A Kenny, I love breaking down tickers with you and we can do so in line with some of the biggest themes this year. And uh we've done this in some other segments here. So I want to hit some tickers that we haven't and this is Apple. This is year to date and what I want to point out here is Apple was really late to the party off of those April 8th low. Finally got started around July, August, and it's been off to the races now hitting record highs. 00:26 Kenny Right. It's taken off, right? It broke out. Not only did it break out of the April low, but then it broke out of back in March, right? We busted up and through that. And now it's part of that AI story, right? We're hearing Apple come out, not only is it the end of the year, they've got new products. Christmas season's coming, holiday season's coming and all that stuff. But in in addition, there's the whole AI theme going on with Apple. So look at it now. It looks like it's completely broken out and will continue in this uptrend. 00:54 Speaker A Now, let's take a look at another hyperscalar, Amazon. And this chart is really interesting to me. 240, a big level here. Looks like we had a little poke above it. Might have been a false breakout. Nevertheless, we got an interesting trading range we're working with here that I'm saying. 01:07 Kenny Right, so I think it was a false breakout because look, we traded it up, we came right back down. It didn't even stop, right? It didn't even stop to test it to see if support was there. It broke right back through. So I think we are stuck in this trading range that you see and you can probably expect it's going to try to hit resistance one or two more times before ultimately breaking out if it's going to break out. I think it is in the new year, but I think it's going to take us some time to do it. 01:31 Speaker A And so you'd wait until the breakout to buy it? 01:32 Kenny I I would wait until the breakout. Now if you already own it, like I already own it, so I'm just not going to do anything with it, right? I'm going I'm going to sit and watch it. But if I see it start to break out, then it may change my mind, cause me to jump in and buy some more. 01:43 Speaker A All right, we're going to stick with the hyperscalar Microsoft and this is another one. It was off to the races in April, but it has fallen off its peak now with NVIDIA. 01:52 Kenny Right. So I think this is just a little bit of gotten dragged into the story that maybe it's a little bit stretched in terms of its valuation. Certainly the fundamental story for Microsoft has not changed, but I do think this whole recent story about um uh the whole AI trade either being in a bubble or being stretched, it's just taken its toll on uh names like Microsoft and NVIDIA. I don't think it's a reason to panic, certainly. We're not anywhere near the lows. It's kind of going to consolidate in here as what it appears to me. But I think you just have to keep your eyes on it. Again, it's a name that I own, so I'm just going to sit and watch and see how it performs. 02:18 Speaker A All right, NVIDIA, we're going to we're going to tackle the OG here. Similar story, similar chart kind of. 02:24 Kenny Right. exactly, right. So we saw how it's taken off. It kind of you know, it it got itself challenged up there in November. It's backed off. It's kind of holding right in here. You want to watch this. See that line that you just drew? Yes. Then you want to watch that and see if it holds that level. If it does and starts to trade up again, I think it's going to remain in that channel. Um, and so you just kind of have to watch it. For me, this would be a hold. Again, we own it, I own it, so I'm just going to continue to watch. If it breaks down below here, then I think you have to watch because then I think there's a there's a potential that it even breaks the September low. That would be something you'd want to keep your eyes on. 02:59 Speaker A All right. Uh let's fast forward to a different sector. This is going to be the banking sector, finance. Here's Bank of America, hitting record highs recently to little fan fair. 03:10 Kenny Right. Well, hitting record highs along if you look at a couple of the other names, you look at the XF uh XLF, the financial ETF, it is also breaking out. Bank of America is another one of those names uh that I own. I like it. I love the fact that, you know, it's broken out here, not with a lot of fan fair, but I like the way it is is acting and it clearly feels to me like it's in this uptrend. It is certainly uh within the within the rails that he just drew. 03:32 Speaker A Yeah, and uh very similar name here, JP Morgan. Now, yeah, it it's kind of broken the uptrend, but it doesn't look like anything critical. It's just kind of consolidating here near the highs. 03:41 Kenny Right. So what it did was it broke that uptrend, but you see it came right down to that level again that you drew and now it's bounced off of that. So I think it's going to remain in this trading range and you're going to want to see whether it breaks up or breaks down based on its next move, right? Whether it's able to pierce up and through the November high there, or whether it's going to back off and come to the November low. 04:02 Speaker A All right, here's another ticker I got from you. I want you to tell me your reasoning on Verizon. Is it for the dividend? What do you like about Verizon? 04:09 Kenny For me, it's just all about stability and dividend in Verizon. It trades in a very tight range. It it it pays about a 6 and 3/4% dividend. It's kind of a it's a big mega cap name. It's very stable. It doesn't, you know, it's not up 150% or down 20% in any one year. It kind of stays stable, but for me, it's all about the stability and the dividend, which I just take and reinvest. 04:31 Speaker A Yeah, uh very good. Um, we have a little bit of time for the quantum trade here. So Ion Q. And this is a multi-year chart here. This goes back I believe to their IPO. Let me just dial up the year to date. And there we go. Uh, bounced, kind of came back to break even. It's very volatile, but 04:51 Kenny It's a very volatile name. It's in the quantum space. and so quantum I think is going to be a big theme going into 2026. It's already a theme now in late 25, but I think as we continue to get on that AI uh narrative and that AI trade, you're going to see specific quantum names and Ionic ION IONQ uh is a name to watch, right? Again, you see how volatile it is. At one point, even just a month ago, it was up about uh what was it up? about I think it was up about 40%. It's now almost flat on the air, but you see it came right back down and bounced, which is a positive sign, right? It could have easily broken and traded back to the March low. It did not. So I want to keep my eyes on that. Again, it's a name that I own, but if it breaks below this line, then I'm going to look to add. 05:31 Speaker A Another quantum trade, surprising. We only got 30 seconds. IBM. Big Blue. Let's do it. 05:35 Kenny I love IBM. Right. I love IBM. It is it is a large mega cap name. takes you all the way back uh to the 1960s. Look, it's There you go. 1960s right here. Yeah, yeah, it's had its great, great move. and what a lot of people don't recognize besides being also a good dividend payer, um, it's got a lot going on in the quantum space. So if you want quantum exposure with a more stable name, IBM is the way to play it. View Comments Terms and Privacy Policy Privacy Dashboard More Info\""

              "'Demand for the iPhone 17 is propelling the outlook for the whole smartphone sector. Annice Lyn / Getty Images Close Key Takeaways Global smartphone shipments are expected to be 1.5% higher in 2025, up from the previous prediction of a 1% gain, thanks to demand for Apple\\'s iPhone 17, according to tech information provider International Data Corporation. IDC said Apple will post a record number of shipments this year because of the success of the iPhone 17, led by demand in China. Apple shares hit a new all-time high Wednesday morning. A new report predicts worldwide smartphone shipments for 2025 will be up 1.5% from 2024, driven by a record-setting performance by Apple ( AAPL ). The Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker from tech information provider International Data Corporation raised its previous outlook of a 1% gain, primarily on the expected soaring demand for Apple’s new iPhone 17 this holiday season. Nabila Popal, senior research director with the study, said that it’s anticipated that Apple will ship more than 247 million iPhones in 2025, a 6.1% jump and an all-time high, “thanks to the phenomenal success of its latest iPhone 17 series.” She pointed to “massive demand” in China that has “significantly accelerated Apple’s performance.\" Why This Is Significant Apple has been one of the few consistent bright spots in the smartphone market, especially in China. IDC’s forecasts are a benchmark for device makers and investors to assess industry momentum, and revisions can shift expectations for companies whose performance is tied to smartphone sales. Apple shares hit a fresh record high Wednesday morning, trading at nearly $289, before falling slightly this afternoon. The stock has gained about 14% since the start of 2025, slightly lagging the performance of the benchmark S&P 500 index. Before the company launched the iPhone 17 in September, sentiment around the stock had deteriorated amid concerns that Apple was trailing its competitors in the race to develop artificial intelligence. At the time, Apple stock was in negative territory for the year—the only member of the Magnificent Seven that was down—but the strong sales of the new iPhone have brought investors back on board. Related Education The Cost of Making an iPhone Here\\'s What Reviewers Like—and Don\\'t Like—About Apple\\'s New iPhone 17 While IDC\\'s guidance for overall smartphone shipments in 2025 is better than the forecast earlier this year, the study noted that the near-term strength won\\'t carry over to next year. It lowered its growth estimate for 2026 to 0.9% from 1.2% because of a shortage of memory chips and product cycle adjustments. Do you have a news tip for Investopedia reporters?

Watch the video above to hear more top stock picks and key investment themes. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination Overtime . Video Transcript 00:00 Speaker A Kenny, I love breaking down tickers with you and we can do so in line with some of the biggest themes this year. And uh we've done this in some other segments here. So I want to hit some tickers that we haven't and this is Apple. This is year to date and what I want to point out here is Apple was really late to the party off of those April 8th low. Finally got started around July, August, and it's been off to the races now hitting record highs. 00:26 Kenny Right. It's taken off, right? It broke out. Not only did it break out of the April low, but then it broke out of back in March, right? We busted up and through that. And now it's part of that AI story, right? We're hearing Apple come out, not only is it the end of the year, they've got new products. Christmas season's coming, holiday season's coming and all that stuff. But in in addition, there's the whole AI theme going on with Apple. So look at it now. It looks like it's completely broken out and will continue in this uptrend. 00:54 Speaker A Now, let's take a look at another hyperscalar, Amazon. And this chart is really interesting to me. 240, a big level here. Looks like we had a little poke above it. Might have been a false breakout. Nevertheless, we got an interesting trading range we're working with here that I'm saying. 01:07 Kenny Right, so I think it was a false breakout because look, we traded it up, we came right back down. It didn't even stop, right? It didn't even stop to test it to see if support was there. It broke right back through. So I think we are stuck in this trading range that you see and you can probably expect it's going to try to hit resistance one or two more times before ultimately breaking out if it's going to break out. I think it is in the new year, but I think it's going to take us some time to do it. 01:31 Speaker A And so you'd wait until the breakout to buy it? 01:32 Kenny I I would wait until the breakout. Now if you already own it, like I already own it, so I'm just not going to do anything with it, right? I'm going I'm going to sit and watch it. But if I see it start to break out, then it may change my mind, cause me to jump in and buy some more. 01:43 Speaker A All right, we're going to stick with the hyperscalar Microsoft and this is another one. It was off to the races in April, but it has fallen off its peak now with NVIDIA. 01:52 Kenny Right. So I think this is just a little bit of gotten dragged into the story that maybe it's a little bit stretched in terms of its valuation. Certainly the fundamental story for Microsoft has not changed, but I do think this whole recent story about um uh the whole AI trade either being in a bubble or being stretched, it's just taken its toll on uh names like Microsoft and NVIDIA. I don't think it's a reason to panic, certainly. We're not anywhere near the lows. It's kind of going to consolidate in here as what it appears to me. But I think you just have to keep your eyes on it. Again, it's a name that I own, so I'm just going to sit and watch and see how it performs. 02:18 Speaker A All right, NVIDIA, we're going to we're going to tackle the OG here. Similar story, similar chart kind of. 02:24 Kenny Right. exactly, right. So we saw how it's taken off. It kind of you know, it it got itself challenged up there in November. It's backed off. It's kind of holding right in here. You want to watch this. See that line that you just drew? Yes. Then you want to watch that and see if it holds that level. If it does and starts to trade up again, I think it's going to remain in that channel. Um, and so you just kind of have to watch it. For me, this would be a hold. Again, we own it, I own it, so I'm just going to continue to watch. If it breaks down below here, then I think you have to watch because then I think there's a there's a potential that it even breaks the September low. That would be something you'd want to keep your eyes on. 02:59 Speaker A All right. Uh let's fast forward to a different sector. This is going to be the banking sector, finance. Here's Bank of America, hitting record highs recently to little fan fair. 03:10 Kenny Right. Well, hitting record highs along if you look at a couple of the other names, you look at the XF uh XLF, the financial ETF, it is also breaking out. Bank of America is another one of those names uh that I own. I like it. I love the fact that, you know, it's broken out here, not with a lot of fan fair, but I like the way it is is acting and it clearly feels to me like it's in this uptrend. It is certainly uh within the within the rails that he just drew. 03:32 Speaker A Yeah, and uh very similar name here, JP Morgan. Now, yeah, it it's kind of broken the uptrend, but it doesn't look like anything critical. It's just kind of consolidating here near the highs. 03:41 Kenny Right. So what it did was it broke that uptrend, but you see it came right down to that level again that you drew and now it's bounced off of that. So I think it's going to remain in this trading range and you're going to want to see whether it breaks up or breaks down based on its next move, right? Whether it's able to pierce up and through the November high there, or whether it's going to back off and come to the November low. 04:02 Speaker A All right, here's another ticker I got from you. I want you to tell me your reasoning on Verizon. Is it for the dividend? What do you like about Verizon? 04:09 Kenny For me, it's just all about stability and dividend in Verizon. It trades in a very tight range. It it it pays about a 6 and 3/4% dividend. It's kind of a it's a big mega cap name. It's very stable. It doesn't, you know, it's not up 150% or down 20% in any one year. It kind of stays stable, but for me, it's all about the stability and the dividend, which I just take and reinvest. 04:31 Speaker A Yeah, uh very good. Um, we have a little bit of time for the quantum trade here. So Ion Q. And this is a multi-year chart here. This goes back I believe to their IPO. Let me just dial up the year to date. And there we go. Uh, bounced, kind of came back to break even. It's very volatile, but 04:51 Kenny It's a very volatile name. It's in the quantum space. and so quantum I think is going to be a big theme going into 2026. It's already a theme now in late 25, but I think as we continue to get on that AI uh narrative and that AI trade, you're going to see specific quantum names and Ionic ION IONQ uh is a name to watch, right? Again, you see how volatile it is. At one point, even just a month ago, it was up about uh what was it up? about I think it was up about 40%. It's now almost flat on the air, but you see it came right back down and bounced, which is a positive sign, right? It could have easily broken and traded back to the March low. It did not. So I want to keep my eyes on that. Again, it's a name that I own, but if it breaks below this line, then I'm going to look to add. 05:31 Speaker A Another quantum trade, surprising. We only got 30 seconds. IBM. Big Blue. Let's do it. 05:35 Kenny I love IBM. Right. I love IBM. It is it is a large mega cap name. takes you all the way back uh to the 1960s. Look, it's There you go. 1960s right here. Yeah, yeah, it's had its great, great move. and what a lot of people don't recognize besides being also a good dividend payer, um, it's got a lot going on in the quantum space. So if you want quantum exposure with a more stable name, IBM is the way to play it. View Comments Terms and Privacy Policy Privacy Dashboard More Info\n",

            "Article Text: Apple's stock is hitting new highs: How to play it with options Yahoo Finance Video and Josh Lipton Wed, December 3, 2025 at 4:26 PM EST AAPL 2025 has been a wild year for Apple ( AAPL ) investors. The stock was out of favor earlier in the year, with investors believing it was lagging in AI. The stock has turned around, though, and is now up about 40% over the last six months, starting to hit new all-time highs at the end of November. StockBrokers.com Director of Investor Research Jessica Inskip explains the trade and why it's a good one for a first-time options investor. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination . Video Transcript 00:00 Speaker A Apple shares on track here to snap a seven-day wind streak, but this under the radar rally has some investors looking for ways to play the tech giant. Join me now, we've got Jessica Inskip, stockbrokers.com, Director of investor research in the options pit sponsored by Tasty Trade. Jessica, it is always great to see you. 00:23 Speaker A So let's talk about Apple, Jessica. I mean what what a story for 2025. Earlier in the year, Jessica, you know, it's out of favor. They've got no AI strategy. What does Tim Cook know know? I I I think I remember some analysts even suggesting maybe it was time for a change in the sea suite in Cupertino. Now's been ahead, that stock's up 40% in six months, but what's the trade on the iPhone maker, Jessica, what do you see? 00:54 Jessica Inskip Yeah, absolutely. When we see a stock like this that's making all-time highs, a lot of time individual retail investors especially, we feel like we need to time the market. We got in too late or whatever that fundamental or even technical reason may be why we like the underlying security. 01:23 Jessica Inskip So the way that we can utilize this with options is by creating an obligation to buy the stock and we can do that by selling a put or a cash secured put. So essentially, we would sell a put, it creates an obligation where I have to buy the stock at the strike price at any time through that expiration period, but in exchange for that obligation, I collect a premium. 01:46 Jessica Inskip And the premium really acts as a buffer or this range that you can create where you put time on your side. So, essentially, first time options traders tend to buy stocks outright or buy calls for their first options trade. When you do that, time is working against you. You actually have negative theta. Positive theta occurs when we sell an option and we're putting time more in our favor. So it's less about timing the market and more about creating this window of time or a time frame and a cushion. 02:19 Speaker A Do you consider Jessica a trade here, like the one you're outline? Is this a good trade for, you know, a relative newbie? Like if I if I'm just getting my feet wet in the options market, is this is this a smart trade? 02:37 Jessica Inskip Yeah, I think it's a great trade for the first time options trader. and often times when you're a first time options trader, you end up buying options rather than selling them. and once again, it's when you can put time on your side. So, for example, the way that I'm constructing this one, I'm going 45 days out because an option is derived from the underlying security. So in this case Apple. 03:00 Jessica Inskip It it has different premium components. We have to consider implied volatility, so a likely movement. We have to consider the time frame when it expires. So by going about 45 days, I have more more in that premium that's excess based rather than just on the underlying security. So I'm going out 45 days so I can maximize basically that decaying. 03:26 Jessica Inskip My strike price I'm choosing is very close to the money, which means it's very close to the current price of the stock, which is 285. I'm collecting a premium of about 675 per share. That was earlier today. I checked before I hopped on and it increased a dollar, so it's almost $8. 03:41 Jessica Inskip But what that does now is I am creating an obligation to buy Apple at $285 per share and I have that obligation for the next about 44 days and I collect $6.75% per share in exchange for that obligation. And basically I've created this range. 04:02 Jessica Inskip Think about about the chart. If we look at Apple around 285, if I go up 675, that's about 291. That is my upwards range, but my downwards range and really my break even is that premium that I receive of 675. My obligation is at 285, but since I already collected 675, my break even is 278.25. 04:26 Jessica Inskip So essentially, for a first-time options trader, we are utilizing the same risk as buying the stock outright, but we're reducing that risk by the premium received. So we're slowly introducing that options component aspect. I like to think of it like a limit buy order. When we're putting in a limit order to buy a stock or Apple in this case, you would still set aside your cash within that limit order. But in this case, we're setting aside our cash that if it hits that obligation kicks in, we're going to have to buy the stock. However, I'm getting paid while I wait and that's the difference here. 05:07 Speaker A Finally, Jessica, before we before we let you go, you know, we talked Apple there, but I just want to get your thoughts bigger picture too. I mean, how should investors think about the the potential of the options market as 2025 draws to a close, Jessica? How how do you want to be positioned here? 05:28 Jessica Inskip Yeah, so I I love to throw a top-down approach with all of my investing and looking at the macro as well. I think when we look at options, we tend to as individual investors look at the market in two dimensions, which is up and down. When we add options, it's actually path. We have a third dimension because now we have strike prices and we have an expiration date. So a price and a destination and a time frame. 05:57 Jessica Inskip So we can utilize the options market even if you don't trade it as purely analytics to understand investor sentiment and we can gauge certainly a lot from that if you're bullish or bearish. 06:12 Jessica Inskip So from the overall macro picture though, and pairing that with what I look at as an individual investor and from an analysis perspective, it is a challenging market that we have right now. Um, I feel like we've hit a ceiling of resistance or very close within the broader markets and we're really waiting on the Fed to cut interest rates, but are those interest rate cuts going to come because the upside risk to the labor market or unemployment rather is higher and that could bleed into your micro and your individual securities. They could sell off within sympathy. So it's really important to think about your macro view and how the micro fits into that overall as well. 06:53 Speaker A Jessica, great as always to have you on the show. Thank you. 06:57 Jessica Inskip Yeah, thank you. View Comments Terms and Privacy Policy Privacy Dashboard More Info\n",

            "Article Text: Apple Design Executive Alan Dye Poached by Meta in Major Coup Mark Gurman Wed, December 3, 2025 at 4:09 PM EST 3 min read AAPL META (Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc. has poached Apple Inc.’s most prominent design executive in a major coup that underscores a push by the social networking giant into AI-equipped consumer devices. The company is hiring Alan Dye, who has served as the head of Apple’s user interface design team since 2015, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Apple is replacing Dye with longtime designer Stephen Lemay, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the personnel changes haven’t been announced. Most Read from Bloomberg Steve Cohen, Bally’s, Genting Picked to Run Casinos in NYC Wealthy New Jersey Town’s Vote on Fixing School Deficit Canceled Alan Dye, attending a GQ event last month, is leaving Apple for Meta.Photographer: Stefanie Keenan/Getty Images Apple confirmed the move in a statement provided to Bloomberg News. “Steve Lemay has played a key role in the design of every major Apple interface since 1999,” Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said in the statement. “He has always set an extraordinarily high bar for excellence and embodies Apple’s culture of collaboration and creativity.” The move represents a seismic shift in Silicon Valley and shows that Meta is committed to becoming a name-brand maker of hardware devices. For Apple, the departure extends an exodus of talent suffered by the design team since the exit of visionary executive Jony Ive in 2019. Dye had taken on a more significant role at Apple after Ive left, helping define how the company’s latest operating systems, apps and devices look and feel. The executive informed Apple this week that he’d decided to leave, though top management had already been bracing for his departure, the people said. With the Dye hire, Meta is creating a new design studio and putting him in charge of design for hardware, software and AI integration for its interfaces. He will be reporting to Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bosworth, who oversees Reality Labs. That group is tasked with developing wearable devices, such as smart glasses and virtual reality headsets. Dye’s major focus will be revamping Meta’s consumer devices with artificial intelligence features. He will serve as chief design officer for the group starting Dec. 31. Dye most recently oversaw the interface of the Vision Pro headset and a sweeping redesign of Apple’s operating systems. He was also central to designing the company’s apps, the Apple Watch and the iPhone X. His team has been helping develop a slate of new smart home devices as well, Bloomberg News has reported. Apple shares slipped nearly 1% to $284.15 in New York on Wednesday. Meta fell 1.2% to $639.60. Dye’s exit is a major loss for Apple, which was already coping with some critical departures in recent weeks. Story Continues Jeff Williams, the company’s longtime chief operating officer, retired last month. And artificial intelligence head John Giannandrea just announced his departure this week following years of struggles to catch up in AI. Last fall, Apple’s former hardware chief Dan Riccio also retired. The turnover is expected to continue, with many of the remaining top leaders, including Cook, nearing typical retirement ages. Johny Srouji, Apple’s silicon chief, and Lisa Jackson, Apple’s head of government environment initiatives, have both been evaluating their futures at the company, Bloomberg has reported. “Design is fundamental to who we are at Apple, and today, we have an extraordinary design team working on the most innovative product lineup in our history,” Cook said in the statement. Joining Dye at Meta is Billy Sorrentino, a prominent deputy who has served as a senior director on Apple’s design team since 2016. Meta’s current design leaders — Joshua To, Jason Rubin and Peter Bristol — also will report to Dye. (Updates shares in 11th paragraph.)

            "Article Text: AI bubble talk isn't constructive as trade is in 'early innings' Yahoo Finance Video and Josh Lipton Wed, December 3, 2025 at 3:47 PM EST AAPL NVDA GOOG ORCL ^DJI Wall Street has gone back and forth over whether the market ( ^DJI , ^IXIC , ^GSPC ) is in an AI bubble or not. Laffer Tengler Investments CEO and CIO Nancy Tengler just doesn't see the market being in a bubble yet. Tengler speaks with Josh Lipton on Market Domination about the difference between the current AI boom and the dot-com crash of the 1990s, and how she expects to invest in the AI trade amid shifting sentiments on the ecosystem's top contenders.

Video Transcript 00:00 Jon Nancy, always great to see you, especially on set. 00:02 Nancy I know. 00:02 Jon Uh, let's start with the great AI bubble debate, because I know you push back on that. Why do you push back, Nancy? 00:09 Nancy So Jon, I mean, listen, at some point maybe we will see a bubble. We're just not there yet in my view. I managed money in the '90s. Um, we we had a very different setup going in. The the leading stocks in terms of capital appreciation were actually experiencing contracting earnings. Our leading stocks in terms of valuation growth are are generating about 20% earnings growth, the growth stocks in this in this whole debate. Uh, CAPEX soared the entire decade. 00:33 Jon Mhm. 00:35 Nancy We're just getting started. So there there's a whole host of other reasons, but I think everybody's making that comparison to the 90s. We were making it three years ago on a whole different set of criteria, but I just don't think that this is constructive because we are in the early innings. 00:46 Jon One theme that really interests me, I'm going to get your take on this is how the narrative narrative around these AI names though, Nancy, how quickly they can shift. What I mean is if we went back earlier this year and I talked about Google, Google was out of favor. Like here comes Open AI and Sam Altman and he's going to crush Google search. Now that stock is a rocket ship. 01:08 Nancy Yeah. 01:08 Jon And I could have told you the same thing about Apple, right? I, you know, Tim Cook, what does he know? He's got no AI strategy. He missed out on the AI CAPEX. That stock's up 40% now in six months. And it works the other way. Like we could talk about Oracle, right? 01:21 Nancy Oracle. 01:21 Jon Larry Ellison, Safra Catz, they're geniuses, it's an AI must own. But then all of a sudden, I have people talking about customer concentration risk and they've got debt worries, and the stock gets whacked. How do you invest through all that? 01:34 Nancy Yeah, it's hard. It's it's exhausting. Um, we added Go what what you do is you anticipate, you try to, you do your research. We added Google 19 months ago. So we're pretty happy in our value strategy. We've owned it in growth for four or five years. We're pretty happy with the holding. Um, I couldn't have told you that that they were going to become the next AI darling, but what I did know is was they weren't going to go out of the search business and they would figure out a way to to monetize AI and they're doing that. With Oracle, I think some of this or most of it is overblown. It's a company that's always used debt, had a debt to equity ratio of 781% last year, growing at half the rate. It's at 500% debt to equity, growing at double the rate with an RPO or, you know, backlog of 312 or 18 billion. Take out the open AI part, they still have robust growth coming. 02:18 Nancy And I think that became the poster child for debt is bad, pair trade on the CDS. So we were in buying last week. Um, Apple, we added, we owned a little bit of it, we added pretty liberally in August, not because we thought they were good at AI, but we thought the the handset trade or the smartphone trade was going to 02:35 Jon Was the iPhone 17? Wow. End of the day. You got it. 02:38 Nancy Um iPhone 17 was going to be a pretty good launch. And you know, I can't tell you. I I don't think they are even in the game in AI. I don't know that they'll ever get in the game. They may have to partner with Google Gemini, but um it is about not following the headlines View Comments Terms and Privacy Policy Privacy Dashboard More Info\n",

            "Article Text: Demand for the iPhone 17 is propelling the outlook for the whole smartphone sector. Annice Lyn / Getty Images Close Key Takeaways Global smartphone shipments are expected to be 1.5% higher in 2025, up from the previous prediction of a 1% gain, thanks to demand for Apple's iPhone 17, according to tech information provider International Data Corporation. IDC said Apple will post a record number of shipments this year because of the success of the iPhone 17, led by demand in China. Apple shares hit a new all-time high Wednesday morning. A new report predicts worldwide smartphone shipments for 2025 will be up 1.5% from 2024, driven by a record-setting performance by Apple ( AAPL ). The Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker from tech information provider International Data Corporation raised its previous outlook of a 1% gain, primarily on the expected soaring demand for Apple’s new iPhone 17 this holiday season. Nabila Popal, senior research director with the study, said that it’s anticipated that Apple will ship more than 247 million iPhones in 2025, a 6.1% jump and an all-time high, “thanks to the phenomenal success of its latest iPhone 17 series.” She pointed to “massive demand” in China that has “significantly accelerated Apple’s performance.\" Why This Is Significant Apple has been one of the few consistent bright spots in the smartphone market, especially in China. IDC’s forecasts are a benchmark for device makers and investors to assess industry momentum, and revisions can shift expectations for companies whose performance is tied to smartphone sales. Apple shares hit a fresh record high Wednesday morning, trading at nearly $289, before falling slightly this afternoon. The stock has gained about 14% since the start of 2025, slightly lagging the performance of the benchmark S&P 500 index. Before the company launched the iPhone 17 in September, sentiment around the stock had deteriorated amid concerns that Apple was trailing its competitors in the race to develop artificial intelligence. At the time, Apple stock was in negative territory for the year—the only member of the Magnificent Seven that was down—but the strong sales of the new iPhone have brought investors back on board. Related Education The Cost of Making an iPhone Here's What Reviewers Like—and Don't Like—About Apple's New iPhone 17 While IDC's guidance for overall smartphone shipments in 2025 is better than the forecast earlier this year, the study noted that the near-term strength won't carry over to next year. It lowered its growth estimate for 2026 to 0.9% from 1.2% because of a shortage of memory chips and product cycle adjustments. Do you have a news tip for Investopedia reporters?

            "Article Text: 3 Ways to Trade Bitcoin’s Big Comeback While Hedging Against a Permanent Crypto Winter Rob Isbitts - Barchart - Wed Dec 3, 1:37PM CST Columnist All information and data in this article is solely for informational purposes. For more information please view the Barchart Disclosure Policy here Share Bitcoin and cash by David McBee via Pexels I hope you’re up for some math. Because when a market event like the recent slide in Bitcoin (BTCUSD) , coupled with Tuesday’s attempted “buy the dip” rally occurs, my number-crunching side really takes over. And for good reason, I think. Because these are the times when the math of risk management couples with the apparent never-say-die attitude of cryptocurrency traders. The result is some of the best reward/risk tradeoffs we’ll see this year. Or next. Why? Because the math makes it so. Specifically, the potential for a deep selloff in a stock or ETF to create a bigger percentage gain required to recover its old high. So if you think there’s a reasonable chance Bitcoin can do that in the next several months or sooner, there’s a reason for intrigue here. And, using option collars, we can see how the math works in another, complementary way. The more volatile an asset, the more favorable the option collar terms. That’s typical, at least. If the options are not liquid, that’s another story. So here, I’m looking at what’s out there for those who want to try to play a Bitcoin comeback that lasts more than a day or week. But not at the risk of losing a huge percentage of their investment. That’s where the collar comes in. The three Bitcoin proxies I’m using here are: www.barchart.com The iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) , the largest spot Bitcoin ETF, with more than $73 billion in assets. Not bad for an ETF still shy of its second anniversary. Those assets are net of a nearly one-third decline in value in under 8 weeks recently. www.barchart.com The Volatility 2X Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITX) , a leveraged ETF tracking Bitcoin’s price. It moves about two times as much as Bitcoin does on a daily basis. That’s a big negative when the underlying asset falls as quickly as Bitcoin just did. www.barchart.com Strategy (MSTR) , the stock formerly known as MicroStrategy, Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin-buying machine. Recently, for obvious reasons, that ship has sailed south, if you will. In the table above, I’ve also included a leveraged version of MSTR. But for the sake of the squeamish in the audience, I’ll refrain from delving into the possibilities of using options on a leveraged stock ETF of a Bitcoin Treasury company. www.barchart.com I just showed you the charts for three of those tickers. Here’s one showing them side by side over the past 3 months. Summary: different degrees of lost capital. But now, with at least a shot at redemption, it’s time to look at how these might be collared. www.barchart.com As a review, for every 100 shares of the ETF or stock purchased , 1 covered call option and one protective put option creates a “collar” around that volatile asset. That means the ticker can trade below the put strike price level, but that option acts like a “get out of jail” card if it does. It allows us to sell the stock at that strike price, until the option expires. We pay for that protection. A lot, these days, given the ride Bitcoin has taken. That’s why the other part of the collar can be helpful. The covered call does limit the upside to that option’s strike price level, but pays us now for potentially stunting our investment’s growth. And, if Bitcoin tanks more, the puts will act as a “worst-case get me out” price through the expiration date. In addition, the calls will fall in value in that case, which means some or potentially all of that cash that flowed into the account for accepting that upside cap would be kept. That assumes the expiration date arrives, and the call strike price has not been reached. I often think of this as a structured, risk-managed, professional game of chicken. Between the market and me, that is. Collar Samples for IBIT, BITX, MSTR Here’s IBIT. I went out to the middle of next year for this one. I accepted some downside (15%) but kept the cost low (2.2%). And the upside of more than 30% makes for a decent 2:1 ratio with the risk. www.barchart.com This is BITX, the 2x leveraged Bitcoin ETF. I don’t own any of these, but I like this one the best. That upside is greater than 50% and the collar only goes out 6 weeks. Sure, there’s some significant downside risk (16%), but the assumption I’m making with all of these sample collar combinations is that the position size will be quite small. And with a stock price of $31.47, 100 shares of BITX can be purchased for only about $3,150. Downside risk of 16% on that is around $500. So for $500 risk, this combination can potentially deliver nearly $1,700 if Bitcoin flies into the new year. www.barchart.com And finally, MSTR. My observation here is that if I’m going to try to play a rally in a stock that has eroded so much value, I’d want a lot more upside than is afforded here. With a much bigger out of pocket net cost for the options, I could pursue that. But that’s not my style. www.barchart.com As I said, this is mainly about the math involved in considering how to use options to trade comeback stories in stocks and ETFs which are already notoriously volatile. As I see it, any time I can use volatility to my advantage as an active trader, the time to crank out the calculations using Barchart’s straightforward presentation of this data is well worth it.

For more information please view the Barchart Disclosure Policy here Share Bar of chocolate by Karandaev via iStock Exclusive offer! Open & fund a Plus500 futures account & trade to get a FREE 1-year Barchart Premier subscription March ICE NY cocoa ( CCH26 ) on Wednesday closed up +49 (+0.90%), and March ICE London cocoa #7 ( CAH26 ) closed down -28 (-0.69%). Cocoa prices settled mixed on Wednesday. Currency fluctuations on Wednesday affected cocoa prices. NY cocoa rose on Wednesday amid a weaker dollar, as the dollar index ( DXY00 ) tumbled to a 5-week low. However, London cocoa was under pressure on Wednesday after the British pound ( ^GBPUSD ) rallied to a 5-week high, undercutting cocoa priced in sterling. Cocoa prices are being undercut by generally favorable weather in West Africa, which is expected to improve yields and boost supplies. Cocoa farmers in the Ivory Coast are reporting that a mix of rain and sunshine is helping cocoa trees bloom, and farmers in Ghana said rains have been regular and helpful to cocoa tree and pod development ahead of the harmattan season. On Monday, cocoa prices posted 2-week highs on positive carryover from last Friday when the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) cut its global 2024/25 cocoa surplus estimate to 49,000 MT from a previous estimate of 142,000 MT and lowered its global 2024/25 cocoa production estimate to 4.69 MMT from a prior estimate of 4.84 MMT. Reduced cocoa arrivals at ports in the Ivory Coast also supported cocoa prices. Monday's government data showed that Ivory Coast farmers shipped 718,451 MT of cocoa to ports this new marketing year, from October 1 through November 30, down 2.1% from 734,026 MT in the same period a year ago. The Ivory Coast is the world's largest cocoa producer. Shrinking ICE cocoa inventories are also supportive of cocoa prices. ICE-monitored cocoa inventories held in US ports fell to an 8.5-month low of 1,685,929 bags on Wednesday. The outlook for ample global cocoa supplies has weighed on prices. On November 19, cocoa prices tumbled to 1.75-year nearest-future lows on expectations of a bumper cocoa crop in West Africa. Reports from Ivory Coast cocoa farmers stated that cocoa trees are doing well, and recent dry weather helped harvested beans dry, while cocoa farmers in Ghana said favorable weather is allowing cocoa pods to develop quickly. Chocolate maker Mondelez recently said that the latest cocoa pod count in West Africa is 7% above the five-year average and \"materially higher\" than last year's crop. The harvest of the Ivory Coast's main crop has just begun, and farmers are optimistic about its quality. Cocoa prices are also under pressure after the European Parliament last Wednesday approved a 1-year delay to the deforestation law, keeping cocoa supplies ample. The EU regulation, known as EUDR, aims to tackle deforestation in countries whose imports into the EU include key commodities such as soybeans and cocoa. The delay of the EUDR will allow EU countries to continue importing agricultural products from regions in Africa, Indonesia, and South America where deforestation is occurring. On November 14, cocoa prices were undercut after the Trump administration announced it had dropped the 10% reciprocal tariffs on commodities not grown in the US, including cocoa, and the 40% tariff on food imports from Brazil. Brazil is among the world's top 10 cocoa-producing countries. Weak global cocoa demand is bearish for prices. On October 30, the CEO of chocolate-maker Hershey said chocolate sales this Halloween season were \"disappointing.\" Halloween made up nearly 18% of annual US candy sales in 2024, second only to Christmas. Meanwhile, the Cocoa Association of Asia on October 17 reported that Q3 Asia cocoa grindings fell by -17% y/y to 183,413, the smallest grindings for a Q3 in 9 years. The European Cocoa Association on October 16 reported that Q3 European cocoa grindings fell -4.8% y/y to 337,353 MT, the lowest for a third quarter in 10 years. The National Confectioners Association reported that Q3 North American cocoa grindings rose +3.2% y/y to 112,784 MT, but the addition of new reporting companies skewed the data. In related news, North American sales volume of chocolate candy was down more than -21% in the 13 weeks ending September 7, compared to the same period last year, according to data from research firm Circana. A supportive factor for cocoa is lower cocoa production in Nigeria, the world's fifth-largest cocoa producer. Nigeria's Cocoa Association projects that Nigeria's 2025/26 cocoa production will fall by -11% y/y to 305,000 MT from a projected 344,000 MT for the 2024/25 crop year. In related news, Nigeria reported that its September cocoa exports were unchanged y/y at 14,511 MT. On May 30, the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) revised its 2023/24 global cocoa deficit to -494,000 MT, the largest deficit in over 60 years. ICCO said 2023/24 cocoa production fell by -12.9% y/y to 4.368 MMT. ICCO stated that the 2023/24 global cocoa stocks-to-grindings ratio declined to a 46-year low of 27.0%. On Friday, the ICCO estimated a 2024/25 global cocoa surplus of 49,000 MT, marking the first surplus in four years. ICCO also said global cocoa production in 2024/25 rose by +7.4% y/y to 4.69 MMT.

            "Article Text: Bitcoin Hits Two-Week High in Cautious Crypto Market Recovery Suvashree Ghosh and Emily Nicolle Wed, December 3, 2025 at 1:29 PM EST 3 min read MSTR STRC STRD STRF STRK (Bloomberg) -- Bitcoin extended a tentative rebound on Wednesday, climbing to a two-week high as traders look for signs that the wider crypto market may be regaining its footing after a prolonged selloff. The original cryptocurrency rose as much as 2.6% to about $93,965, its highest intraday level since Nov. 17. Ether gained more, rising more than 4%, as Ethereum undergoes a network upgrade called Fusaka that aims to make the blockchain faster and more efficient. Other smaller tokens were mixed. Most Read from Bloomberg Steve Cohen, Bally’s, Genting Picked to Run Casinos in NYC Wealthy New Jersey Town’s Vote on Fixing School Deficit Canceled The digital assets market remains on shaky ground after a bruising selloff that began in early October, just days after Bitcoin hit a record of over $126,000. Since then, more than $1 trillion in crypto market value has been wiped out. Still, a measure of optimism is appearing with investors hoping the recovery can build. “Bitcoin fans will be rightly cautious about this rally in the cryptocurrency, having seen so many false dawns in recent months, but it looks like the recovery in stock market risk appetite is finally leaching across into the crypto space,” Chris Beauchamp, UK chief market analyst at investment and trading platform IG, said in a note. “Last week’s bounce faltered at $93,000, so with the price nudging above this in early trading there is some hope of a more sustained move higher.” Crypto traders have endured a bumpy ride this week. Token prices tumbled on Monday following comments by Strategy Inc.’s Chief Executive Officer Phong Le that the Bitcoin accumulator could resort to selling the cryptocurrency if needed to make debt payments. Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, said later that it was establishing a $1.4 billion reserve to have cash readily available. WATCH: Mike McGlone reports on the reobund in Bitcoin.Source: Bloomberg Bitcoin then regained ground Tuesday, with traders pointing to Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Paul Atkins’ plan to unveil the measures behind an “innovation exemption” for digital asset companies, and Vanguard Group’s decision to allow exchange-traded funds and mutual funds that primarily hold cryptocurrencies to be traded on its platform. Those events, coupled with a new bottom emerging for Bitcoin this week, have created “a series of vital signs of an upward trend forming,” according to FxPro’s Chief Market Analyst Alex Kuptsikevich. Even so, caution has persisted, with some suggesting that investors bruised by the downturn may be reluctant to chase the move. “We don’t see a ton of buyers on the top side,” said Sean McNulty, APAC derivatives trading lead at FalconX. “Sentiment is still fragile.” Story Continues One barometer of investor confidence is the group of 12 US-listed ETFs investing in Bitcoin, which recorded what McNulty called a “feeble” $59 million inflow on Tuesday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The latest rally has led to liquidations of about $400 million worth of bearish bets across all tokens in the past 24 hours, Coinglass data shows. “This rebound is actually just a relief rally,” said Melvin Deng, chief executive officer of QCP Group, in an interview on Bloomberg TV. But Bitcoin could “reclaim some momentum” from here, he added. “This is a great point for those who are under-deployed to look at some entry level.” --With assistance from Sidhartha Shukla.

              "\"Apple's 6 straight records, bitcoin recovery: Market takeaways Yahoo Finance Video Tue, December 2, 2025 at 5:00 PM CST ^IXIC BTC-USD ^DJI ^GSPC DX-Y.NYB Yahoo Finance Markets and Data Editor Jared Blikre joins Asking for a Trend host Josh Lipton to discuss three key takeaways from Tuesday's trading session: Apple ( AAPL ) hitting six straight records, how the US dollar ( DX-Y.NYB ) is moving, and bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) beginning to make a recovery. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Asking for a Trend . Video Transcript 00:00 Speaker A Let's uh focus on Apple first and this is a volatility here or the dollar. We'll get to that in a second, but we're going to talk about Apple's six straight records. In fact, it's been up seven days straight. Six of those, the last ones were record closes. So let's take a look. I'm going to show our uh Nasdaq 100 heat map. Let's do that. And we can see over the last 10 days, it's been up roughly 7%. and uh, this is kind of a comeback story for Apple. 00:41 Speaker A Here's the last 10 days and I will show you also the year to date, which really shows you how it was kind of lagging the rest of the market for a long time. But there you go. that's 7% in 10 days. Here is the year to date and you can see after the April 8th low that so many markets rocketed up after, well, they just went sideways for two months. And so that was Apple's story until very recently. Fortunately, it's come alive and it's not just sector rotation that is the lifeblood of bull markets, it's individual stock rotation. 01:14 Speaker A And as Nvidia here is up another 86 basis points. That's nice to see. Also want to mention that another seven-day streak was notched by the Philly Sox and that is the chip index and we're seeing not a lot of outsize uh performance by Nvidia today, but Intel up almost uh 8 and a half% there. NXP up 8%, Texas instruments up 4%. So we're really seeing the socks and a lot of the chip indices do their jobs. So, whatever the uh market might tell you or some of the headlines might tell you that 01:48 Speaker A AI chip, I believe is still alive and well here even if we're not talking about record highs by Nvidia every single day. 01:55 Speaker B Now, I was out yesterday. Yes. as you know, but I heard there's some some interesting things going on with the dollar, the yen. What'd I miss? 02:02 Speaker A Yes, so the yen was kind of an interesting tricky situation yesterday for a brief moment. I'm not going to rehash all the details because it looks like it's over with, but nevertheless, it really got me to looking at the US dollar index and there was a some movement and this is what I was actually looking at at the very beginning of this segment. This is the year to date on the US dollar index. And you can see it's gone sideways for about six months here, but if you look, you can see it's kind of a rounded base. 02:37 Speaker A and what I really was looking at is the 50-day moving average and that's that blue line that you're seeing right there. And if you squint, you can see we just barely touched it yesterday and we actually jumped off of it. So I'm going to dial this down to a two-month chart and then I'm going to put some candlesticks here and you can see, if you squint, um this is what we call a wick on the candlestick or a tail or a couple of other things. The shadow is also what it's called. 03:02 Speaker A Nevertheless, we dipped down to that big fat 99 level and then we got a nice bounce up and we're closing above. As long as the uh US dollar index is above this, um we still have the potential for this thing to surge above 100.5. And the reason that's big is because Wall Street is very much positioned short. There's a lot of bearish sentiment against the dollar and I think that would squeeze not only commodities, not only crypto, but maybe stocks as well. So what I'm watching for is the dollar 03:36 Speaker A index around this 50-day moving average to the downside. If it cracks it, well, that's probably going to be good for the markets. And then if we race higher and race above this red line here at 100.5, well, I think that's going to be a problem for the market and that's not what the market is expecting in December because if everything goes well, well, we should have we should be watching paint dry in a couple of weeks and you know, that's that's the way things are supposed to happen here. 04:02 Speaker A Um, this is a 10-year T-note yield. Also want to point out that it moved, had a big move yesterday. Um, let me put a year to date and get all these lines off of it so we can see what's going on here. Um, as you can see, it's at the bottom end of its range here. Usually the trouble in the bond market comes when it moves too fast. It's not the absolute levels. However, having said that when the 30-year, when the 30-year was right up about 5, 5.1% in here, 04:34 Speaker A that was causing, that level was causing a problem for the market. The fact that it's down here, I don't think the levels are a problem, but if it were to rapidly rise along with the US dollar, that would be a problem. So we're just talking about things to watch about in the future, not that we have these problems right now. 04:53 Speaker B What about Bitcoin? 04:54 Speaker A Let's take a look at Bitcoin here. Yeah, it was a, I always look if you take the 5:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. close basically over the last 24 hours or so, we were having the best day since April 9th. That was that day that the Nasdaq went up about, what was it, 10% something like that. An incredible day. So it's interesting that it's doing that right now. And let me pull up the uh Bitcoin ticker here. There we go. 91,507. 05:27 Speaker A I'll just show you the last five days price action because here's when we had that huge dip and this was actually concurrent with uh that Bank of Japan announcement or the the hint that they were going to raise rates. There was this huge downside reaction, probably an over reaction in Bitcoin. Nevertheless, what I like about this chart is it found support right around 85,000, then we saw it rocket back up. So this is, is it the is this a bottom right here? 06:03 Speaker A It could be. Um I'm a little skeptical because I think we need to wash out all the cheap stops below 75,000. I'd like to see to get really bullish. I'd love to see 75,000 taken out. Um wash out all those stops and then see it rocket right back up to like 75, 80, 85,000 within a couple of days. Absent that, um, you know, it's nice to see these things, but it could be a sucker's rally and really until we clear 92,000 and then 06:44 Speaker A the big number is 110,000. That's pretty far away. Until we clear 110,000, I don't think we're uh clear. 06:50 Speaker B Looking ahead to what's on your radar? 06:53 Speaker A Um, we have a couple so we have a fed announcement, we have CPI, we're going to get November payrolls two weeks late. One of the things I was looking at this morning, there's a lot of interesting discussion around the Supreme Court decision on the Trump tariffs. And we don't know when that's going to be. We had arguments on November 5th. So the Supreme Court could make an announcement this month, they could do it next spring and so that's a pretty wide period of time. 07:23 Speaker A But it's interesting because I've heard arguments that it would be dollar supportive and dollar negative at the same time, uh coming from different sides. So we'll have to see where it lands, but that's why I was outlining my logic on the dollar. All you got to do is watch the price action above 100.5. Um that's a problem and then below that 50-day moving average, probably smooth sailing into the end of the year. 07:51 Speaker B All right, thank you buddy. Appreciate it.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) and Micron Technology, Inc.

You can read today's AWS here >>> Pre-markets Move Back into the Green, SIG Beats by +293% Today's Featured Research Reports Apple’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry over the past year (+17.6% vs. +16.7%). The company is benefiting from strong growth in Services revenues. The company now has more than 1 billion paid subscribers across its Services portfolio. The new iPhone 17 series is expected to drive top-line growth. Expanding capabilities of AI Intelligence is noteworthy. Apple expects the December quarter’s (first-quarter fiscal 2026) net sales to grow between 10% and 12% on a year-over-year basis. The company expects iPhone sales to grow by double digits year over year. The Mac segment is expected to face tough year-over-year comps, and Services are expected to grow at the 2025 rate. However, gross margin is expected to be 47-48% in the first quarter of fiscal 2026, including a tariff impact of $1.4 billion. Increasing regulatory headwinds and tariffs are a concern. AAPL shares are hitting all-time highs this afternoon. (You can read the full research report on Apple here >>> ) Shares of Tesla have outperformed the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry over the past year (+22.5% vs. +21.1%). The company set a new delivery record in Q3, but much of it came from buyers rushing to claim the expiring $7,500 EV tax credit. With incentives withdrawn and competition from Chinese EV makers intensifying, Q4 deliveries are expected to drop. Sales are falling across key markets, with Europe leading the downturn. Story Continues Automotive margins are expected to be under pressure. Still, there are a few bright spots. The Energy Generation & Storage unit is thriving, and the Supercharger network continues to expand. Tesla’s robotaxi service, launched in Austin in June, has been expanded to California, Nevada and Arizona. The company’s big pivot into artificial intelligence (AI), autonomous driving and robotics bode well, but these projects could take years to yield meaningful results. For now, we are cautious on the stock. (You can read the full research report on Tesla here >>> ) Micron Technology’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry over the year-to-date period (+188.2% vs. +80.9%). The company is benefiting from the rapidly expanding AI-driven memory and storage markets. The positive impacts of inventory improvement across multiple end-markets are driving top-line growth. The surging demand for HBM and robust DRAM pricing recovery will aid significant revenue and earnings growth in the coming quarters. Its solid financials, positive free cash flow and strong balance sheet provide the flexibility to invest in growth initiatives while enhancing shareholder value. Micron Technology’s long-term customer agreements and expanding AI partnerships reduce volatility and enhance revenue visibility. Nonetheless, a slower-than-expected demand recovery in NAND may hurt the overall financial performance. An escalating trade war is another concern. (You can read the full research report on Micron Technology here >>> ) Shares of Hamilton Beach Brands have declined -0.9% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Household Appliances industry’s decline of -25.2%. This microcap company with a market capitalization of $211.06 million has survived the 2025 tariff shock, as U.S.-China rates have eased. Its biggest retailer is ordering normally again, and holiday promos are strong, supporting restocking-led volume into 4Q and 2026. 3Q gross margin fell to 21.1% on a one-time $5M tariff hit and pricing lag, but June/Aug price actions and broader APAC sourcing should restore and lift margins as its mix skews toward higher value. Health (HealthBeacon) posted its first operating profit with 50% subscription growth for the first nine months of 2025, major specialty-pharmacy deals, and new software rollouts abroad. Lotus premium appliances are beating sell-through and gaining shelf space, raising ASPs. Commercial Sunkist products are resilient and set to grow in 2026. Its balance sheet is flexible ($66M revolver), with buybacks/dividends and $10M annualized cost cuts boosting leverage. (You can read the full research report on Hamilton Beach Brands here >>> ) Key Tronic’s shares have underperformed the Zacks Electronics - Miscellaneous Products industry over the year-to-date period (-34.8% vs. +27.3%). This microcap company with a market capitalization of $28.34 million is facing risks which include prolonged revenue declines, delayed program ramps, backlog erosion, fixed-cost underutilization, high debt with limited cash, elevated inventory/receivable exposure, and tariff/geopolitical uncertainty that could further slow conversions and pressure liquidity. Nevertheless, Key Tronic is a leveraged reshoring/near-shoring EMS play. New U.S. (Springdale, AR) and Vietnam capacity should put ~50% of output in these regions by fiscal 2026, matching OEM demand for resilient supply chains and supporting share gains. Cost actions and Mexico supply-chain efficiencies are lifting sequential gross margin (8.4%) and lowering breakeven. Vertically integrated PCB, plastics, automation and testing, plus new medical, industrial and data-processing programs (>$20 million annualized by fiscal 2026), improve forward visibility and mix. (You can read the full research report on Key Tronic here >>> ) Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include ConocoPhillips (COP), Edison International (EIX) and Fortive Corp. (FTV).

However, declining oil prices raise concerns. Fortive (FTV) Gains from Diversified Portfolio and Margins Per the Zacks analyst, Fortive diversified portfolio across automation, digitization and electrification provides resilience. Margin growth efforts through restructuring and the FBS toolkit bode well. Solid West Coast Asset Base Aids Essex Property (ESS) Amid High Supply Per the Zacks Analyst, ESS is set for growth with a sturdy property base in the West Coast market with favorable demand drivers. However, a high supply of rental units in certain markets is a concern. Everest Group (EG) Banks on Solid Premiums Amid High Costs Per the Zacks analyst, Everest Group is set to grow on solid Insurance segment on the back of new business opportunities, which drives premium growth. However, high costs remain a concern. Service Center Unit Aids Applied Industrial (AIT), Costs Ail Per the Zacks analyst, Applied Industrial's Service Center Based Distribution segment is driven by sales initiatives and focus on national customer accounts. However, high costs remain concerning. Immunovant Bets on IMVT-1402 as Thin Pipeline Remains a Major Concern Per the Zacks Analyst, IMVT's steady progress across autoimmune programs is promising, but its narrow pipeline and fierce competition in the immunology space could hinder long-term growth. RH Advances on Expansion Efforts, Though Housing Weakness Remains Per the Zacks analyst, RH's diversified portfolio, global expansion, and digital efforts are driving momentum. However, tariff risks and a weak U.S. housing market remain key headwinds. New Upgrades Investments and Renewable Energy Focus Aid Edison International (EIX) According to the Zacks analyst, Edison International aims to invest $28-$29 billion through 2028, which should further strengthen its operations and expand its renewable portfolio. Crocs (CROX) Benefits From Innovations and Strategic Collaborations Per the Zacks analyst, Crocs drives growth through strategic collaborations and product innovations to deliver profitable expansion. It is refreshing HEYDUDE's lineup and prioritizing brand health.

This keeps Kohl's on track to accomplish a $2 billion beauty business. New Downgrades Shortage of Labor and Supply Chain Challenges Ail Boeing (BA) Per the Zacks analyst, Boeing faces risks from labor shortages that could slow production, raise costs, and affect quality. Supply-chain issues and higher U.S. import tariffs add further pressure. Landstar (LSTR) Continues to Grapple With Weak Freight Market Per the Zacks analyst, weakness in overall volumes due to headwinds like weak freight demand, supply-chain woes and slower network velocity are hurting the top line. Macroeconomic Challenges, Intense Rivalry Ails Bruker (BRKR) The Zacks analyst is concerned with macroeconomic impacts, including global tariffs and U.S. academic funding headwinds, weighing on Bruker's operations. Competitive pressures may hurt its growth. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Asking for a Trend . Video Transcript 00:00 Speaker A Let's uh focus on Apple first and this is a volatility here or the dollar. We'll get to that in a second, but we're going to talk about Apple's six straight records. In fact, it's been up seven days straight. Six of those, the last ones were record closes. So let's take a look. I'm going to show our uh Nasdaq 100 heat map. Let's do that. And we can see over the last 10 days, it's been up roughly 7%. and uh, this is kind of a comeback story for Apple. 00:41 Speaker A Here's the last 10 days and I will show you also the year to date, which really shows you how it was kind of lagging the rest of the market for a long time. But there you go. that's 7% in 10 days. Here is the year to date and you can see after the April 8th low that so many markets rocketed up after, well, they just went sideways for two months. And so that was Apple's story until very recently. Fortunately, it's come alive and it's not just sector rotation that is the lifeblood of bull markets, it's individual stock rotation. 01:14 Speaker A And as Nvidia here is up another 86 basis points. That's nice to see. Also want to mention that another seven-day streak was notched by the Philly Sox and that is the chip index and we're seeing not a lot of outsize uh performance by Nvidia today, but Intel up almost uh 8 and a half% there. NXP up 8%, Texas instruments up 4%. So we're really seeing the socks and a lot of the chip indices do their jobs. So, whatever the uh market might tell you or some of the headlines might tell you that 01:48 Speaker A AI chip, I believe is still alive and well here even if we're not talking about record highs by Nvidia every single day. 01:55 Speaker B Now, I was out yesterday. Yes. as you know, but I heard there's some some interesting things going on with the dollar, the yen. What'd I miss? 02:02 Speaker A Yes, so the yen was kind of an interesting tricky situation yesterday for a brief moment. I'm not going to rehash all the details because it looks like it's over with, but nevertheless, it really got me to looking at the US dollar index and there was a some movement and this is what I was actually looking at at the very beginning of this segment. This is the year to date on the US dollar index. And you can see it's gone sideways for about six months here, but if you look, you can see it's kind of a rounded base. 02:37 Speaker A and what I really was looking at is the 50-day moving average and that's that blue line that you're seeing right there. And if you squint, you can see we just barely touched it yesterday and we actually jumped off of it. So I'm going to dial this down to a two-month chart and then I'm going to put some candlesticks here and you can see, if you squint, um this is what we call a wick on the candlestick or a tail or a couple of other things. The shadow is also what it's called. 03:02 Speaker A Nevertheless, we dipped down to that big fat 99 level and then we got a nice bounce up and we're closing above. As long as the uh US dollar index is above this, um we still have the potential for this thing to surge above 100.5. And the reason that's big is because Wall Street is very much positioned short. There's a lot of bearish sentiment against the dollar and I think that would squeeze not only commodities, not only crypto, but maybe stocks as well. So what I'm watching for is the dollar 03:36 Speaker A index around this 50-day moving average to the downside. If it cracks it, well, that's probably going to be good for the markets. And then if we race higher and race above this red line here at 100.5, well, I think that's going to be a problem for the market and that's not what the market is expecting in December because if everything goes well, well, we should have we should be watching paint dry in a couple of weeks and you know, that's that's the way things are supposed to happen here. 04:02 Speaker A Um, this is a 10-year T-note yield. Also want to point out that it moved, had a big move yesterday. Um, let me put a year to date and get all these lines off of it so we can see what's going on here. Um, as you can see, it's at the bottom end of its range here. Usually the trouble in the bond market comes when it moves too fast. It's not the absolute levels. However, having said that when the 30-year, when the 30-year was right up about 5, 5.1% in here, 04:34 Speaker A that was causing, that level was causing a problem for the market. The fact that it's down here, I don't think the levels are a problem, but if it were to rapidly rise along with the US dollar, that would be a problem. So we're just talking about things to watch about in the future, not that we have these problems right now. 04:53 Speaker B What about Bitcoin? 04:54 Speaker A Let's take a look at Bitcoin here. Yeah, it was a, I always look if you take the 5:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. close basically over the last 24 hours or so, we were having the best day since April 9th. That was that day that the Nasdaq went up about, what was it, 10% something like that. An incredible day. So it's interesting that it's doing that right now. And let me pull up the uh Bitcoin ticker here. There we go. 91,507. 05:27 Speaker A I'll just show you the last five days price action because here's when we had that huge dip and this was actually concurrent with uh that Bank of Japan announcement or the the hint that they were going to raise rates. There was this huge downside reaction, probably an over reaction in Bitcoin. Nevertheless, what I like about this chart is it found support right around 85,000, then we saw it rocket back up. So this is, is it the is this a bottom right here? 06:03 Speaker A It could be. Um I'm a little skeptical because I think we need to wash out all the cheap stops below 75,000. I'd like to see to get really bullish. I'd love to see 75,000 taken out. Um wash out all those stops and then see it rocket right back up to like 75, 80, 85,000 within a couple of days. Absent that, um, you know, it's nice to see these things, but it could be a sucker's rally and really until we clear 92,000 and then 06:44 Speaker A the big number is 110,000. That's pretty far away. Until we clear 110,000, I don't think we're uh clear. 06:50 Speaker B Looking ahead to what's on your radar? 06:53 Speaker A Um, we have a couple so we have a fed announcement, we have CPI, we're going to get November payrolls two weeks late. One of the things I was looking at this morning, there's a lot of interesting discussion around the Supreme Court decision on the Trump tariffs. And we don't know when that's going to be. We had arguments on November 5th. So the Supreme Court could make an announcement this month, they could do it next spring and so that's a pretty wide period of time. 07:23 Speaker A But it's interesting because I've heard arguments that it would be dollar supportive and dollar negative at the same time, uh coming from different sides. So we'll have to see where it lands, but that's why I was outlining my logic on the dollar. All you got to do is watch the price action above 100.5. Um that's a problem and then below that 50-day moving average, probably smooth sailing into the end of the year. 07:51 Speaker B All right, thank you buddy. Appreciate it.

            "Article Text: Boeing was the top-performing stock in the S&P 500 on Tuesday, Dec. 2, 2025. GIUSEPPE CACACE / AFP via Getty Images Close Key Takeaways An aerospace giant got a lift on Tuesday, Dec. 2, 2025, as an executive provided an optimistic forecast for deliveries and free cash flow, while a major chipmaker extended its rally. Boeing shares took off after the plane maker's chief financial officer offered a bright outlook for 2026. Intel stock added to its recent string of gains amid speculation about new business from Apple. Shares of an aircraft manufacturer skyrocketed as a top executive said deliveries and free cash flow would trend higher in 2026, while a large semiconductor player extended its hot streak. Major U.S. equities indexes moved higher Tuesday, recovering from a sell-off in the prior session. The S&P 500 advanced 0.3%, the Dow added 0.4%, and the Nasdaq gained 0.6%. In another bright sign for risk assets, the price of Bitcoin ( BTCUSD ) clawed back some of its recent losses. See here for Investopedia's full coverage of today's top market stories. Boeing ( BA ) shares soared 10.2%, notching the top performance in the S&P 500, after Chief Financial Officer Jay Malave provided an optimistic outlook for the aircraft manufacturer heading into 2026. Speaking at an industry conference, the executive touted Boeing's progress on its recovery plans and said the company expects to increase deliveries of its 737 and 787 jets next year. The plane maker also anticipates strong free cash flow growth in 2026. Intel ( INTC ) shares jumped 8.7%, adding to gains posted late last week amid speculation that Apple ( AAPL ) could be poised to become a new Intel customer . A potential deal with the iPhone maker would come on top of a string of high-profile agreements for Intel this year, including a partnership with AI darling Nvidia ( NVDA ). Stifel upgraded Teradyne ( TER ) stock to \"buy\" from \"hold,\" and shares of the technology testing solutions provider gained 5.7%. Analysts pointed to a shift in Teradyne's focus toward high-growth markets, with AI applications expected to account for a more substantial portion of the firm's semiconductor test revenue as the business expands beyond its traditional smartphone and consumer markets. Companies in the paper and packaging business came under pressure Tuesday. The industry has faced concerns about sluggish consumer spending, elevated costs, and excess supply. Packaging Corporation of America ( PKG ) shares sank 5.3%. In its most recent earnings report released in October, Packaging Corp. posted lower-than-expected profit. Shares of competitors International Paper ( IP ) and Smurfit WestRock ( SW ) each fell 3.4% on Tuesday. AutoZone ( AZO ) shares slipped 3.1% following cautious commentary about the auto parts retailer from analysts at Morgan Stanley. The investment bank noted that AutoZone could face cost headwinds related to tariffs and increases in selling, general, and administrative expenses, although analysts still believe the company is positioned to benefit from positive industry trends.

            "Article Text: Shares of Intel ( INTC +8.55% ) gained on Tuesday, finishing the day up 8.7%. The rise came as the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite jumped 0.2% and 0.5%, respectively. Intel's stock continued to climb today, driven by Friday's unconfirmed report that the chipmaker is set to begin manufacturing semiconductors for Apple 's MacBook Air and iPad Pro. Expand NASDAQ : INTC Intel Today's Change ( 8.55 %) $ 3.42 Current Price $ 43.43 Key Data Points Market Cap $191B Day's Range $ 40.06 - $ 43.67 52wk Range $ 17.66 - $ 43.67 Volume 3.6M Avg Vol 110M Gross Margin 35.58 % Dividend Yield N/A Intel could be partnering with Apple On Friday, TF International analyst Ming-Chi Kuo claimed on X that Intel will supply Apple with its lower-end M processors, which power the iPad Pro and MacBook Air. The first shipments are expected as early as the second quarter of 2027. If the report is confirmed, it would be a massive win for the embattled chipmaker. Intel once dominated the semiconductor industry with its efficient CPUs, but it has fallen behind in the era of artificial intelligence (AI), a technology that is powered primarily by GPUs. A vote of confidence from Apple would go a long way in aiding the company's turnaround efforts . Image source: Getty Images. Intel has a rocky road ahead Even if the report is proven to be true, Intel would still be in a difficult position. The company's workforce has been reduced dramatically, and much of its key talent has jumped ship. That being said, I believe it will be able to turn the ship around and succeed in the long run.\n",

            "Article Text: Top Research Reports for Apple, Tesla & Micron Technology Mark Vickery Tue, December 2, 2025 at 3:34 PM CST 8 min read AAPL TSLA MU KTCC HBB Tuesday, December 2, 2025 The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) and Micron Technology, Inc. (MU), as well as two micro-cap stocks: Hamilton Beach Brands Holding Co. (HBB) and Key Tronic Corp. (KTCC). The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today. You can see all of today’s research reports here >>> Ahead of Wall Street The daily 'Ahead of Wall Street' article is a must-read for all investors who would like to be ready for that day's trading action.

You can read today's AWS here >>> Pre-markets Move Back into the Green, SIG Beats by +293% Today's Featured Research Reports Apple’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry over the past year (+17.6% vs. +16.7%). The company is benefiting from strong growth in Services revenues. The company now has more than 1 billion paid subscribers across its Services portfolio. The new iPhone 17 series is expected to drive top-line growth. Expanding capabilities of AI Intelligence is noteworthy. Apple expects the December quarter’s (first-quarter fiscal 2026) net sales to grow between 10% and 12% on a year-over-year basis. The company expects iPhone sales to grow by double digits year over year. The Mac segment is expected to face tough year-over-year comps, and Services are expected to grow at the 2025 rate. However, gross margin is expected to be 47-48% in the first quarter of fiscal 2026, including a tariff impact of $1.4 billion. Increasing regulatory headwinds and tariffs are a concern. AAPL shares are hitting all-time highs this afternoon. (You can read the full research report on Apple here >>> ) Shares of Tesla have outperformed the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry over the past year (+22.5% vs. +21.1%). The company set a new delivery record in Q3, but much of it came from buyers rushing to claim the expiring $7,500 EV tax credit. With incentives withdrawn and competition from Chinese EV makers intensifying, Q4 deliveries are expected to drop. Sales are falling across key markets, with Europe leading the downturn. Story Continues Automotive margins are expected to be under pressure. Still, there are a few bright spots. The Energy Generation & Storage unit is thriving, and the Supercharger network continues to expand. Tesla’s robotaxi service, launched in Austin in June, has been expanded to California, Nevada and Arizona. The company’s big pivot into artificial intelligence (AI), autonomous driving and robotics bode well, but these projects could take years to yield meaningful results. For now, we are cautious on the stock. (You can read the full research report on Tesla here >>> ) Micron Technology’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry over the year-to-date period (+188.2% vs. +80.9%). The company is benefiting from the rapidly expanding AI-driven memory and storage markets. The positive impacts of inventory improvement across multiple end-markets are driving top-line growth. The surging demand for HBM and robust DRAM pricing recovery will aid significant revenue and earnings growth in the coming quarters. Its solid financials, positive free cash flow and strong balance sheet provide the flexibility to invest in growth initiatives while enhancing shareholder value. Micron Technology’s long-term customer agreements and expanding AI partnerships reduce volatility and enhance revenue visibility. Nonetheless, a slower-than-expected demand recovery in NAND may hurt the overall financial performance. An escalating trade war is another concern. (You can read the full research report on Micron Technology here >>> ) Shares of Hamilton Beach Brands have declined -0.9% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Household Appliances industry’s decline of -25.2%. This microcap company with a market capitalization of $211.06 million has survived the 2025 tariff shock, as U.S.-China rates have eased. Its biggest retailer is ordering normally again, and holiday promos are strong, supporting restocking-led volume into 4Q and 2026. 3Q gross margin fell to 21.1% on a one-time $5M tariff hit and pricing lag, but June/Aug price actions and broader APAC sourcing should restore and lift margins as its mix skews toward higher value. Health (HealthBeacon) posted its first operating profit with 50% subscription growth for the first nine months of 2025, major specialty-pharmacy deals, and new software rollouts abroad. Lotus premium appliances are beating sell-through and gaining shelf space, raising ASPs. Commercial Sunkist products are resilient and set to grow in 2026. Its balance sheet is flexible ($66M revolver), with buybacks/dividends and $10M annualized cost cuts boosting leverage. (You can read the full research report on Hamilton Beach Brands here >>> ) Key Tronic’s shares have underperformed the Zacks Electronics - Miscellaneous Products industry over the year-to-date period (-34.8% vs. +27.3%). This microcap company with a market capitalization of $28.34 million is facing risks which include prolonged revenue declines, delayed program ramps, backlog erosion, fixed-cost underutilization, high debt with limited cash, elevated inventory/receivable exposure, and tariff/geopolitical uncertainty that could further slow conversions and pressure liquidity. Nevertheless, Key Tronic is a leveraged reshoring/near-shoring EMS play. New U.S. (Springdale, AR) and Vietnam capacity should put ~50% of output in these regions by fiscal 2026, matching OEM demand for resilient supply chains and supporting share gains. Cost actions and Mexico supply-chain efficiencies are lifting sequential gross margin (8.4%) and lowering breakeven. Vertically integrated PCB, plastics, automation and testing, plus new medical, industrial and data-processing programs (>$20 million annualized by fiscal 2026), improve forward visibility and mix. (You can read the full research report on Key Tronic here >>> ) Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include ConocoPhillips (COP), Edison International (EIX) and Fortive Corp. (FTV).

However, declining oil prices raise concerns. Fortive (FTV) Gains from Diversified Portfolio and Margins Per the Zacks analyst, Fortive diversified portfolio across automation, digitization and electrification provides resilience. Margin growth efforts through restructuring and the FBS toolkit bode well. Solid West Coast Asset Base Aids Essex Property (ESS) Amid High Supply Per the Zacks Analyst, ESS is set for growth with a sturdy property base in the West Coast market with favorable demand drivers. However, a high supply of rental units in certain markets is a concern. Everest Group (EG) Banks on Solid Premiums Amid High Costs Per the Zacks analyst, Everest Group is set to grow on solid Insurance segment on the back of new business opportunities, which drives premium growth. However, high costs remain a concern. Service Center Unit Aids Applied Industrial (AIT), Costs Ail Per the Zacks analyst, Applied Industrial's Service Center Based Distribution segment is driven by sales initiatives and focus on national customer accounts. However, high costs remain concerning. Immunovant Bets on IMVT-1402 as Thin Pipeline Remains a Major Concern Per the Zacks Analyst, IMVT's steady progress across autoimmune programs is promising, but its narrow pipeline and fierce competition in the immunology space could hinder long-term growth. RH Advances on Expansion Efforts, Though Housing Weakness Remains Per the Zacks analyst, RH's diversified portfolio, global expansion, and digital efforts are driving momentum. However, tariff risks and a weak U.S. housing market remain key headwinds. New Upgrades Investments and Renewable Energy Focus Aid Edison International (EIX) According to the Zacks analyst, Edison International aims to invest $28-$29 billion through 2028, which should further strengthen its operations and expand its renewable portfolio. Crocs (CROX) Benefits From Innovations and Strategic Collaborations Per the Zacks analyst, Crocs drives growth through strategic collaborations and product innovations to deliver profitable expansion. It is refreshing HEYDUDE's lineup and prioritizing brand health. Kohl's (KSS) Partnership with Sephora to Boost Beauty Business Per the Zacks analyst, Kohl's is gaining from its partnership with Sephora, which posted 2% net sales growth in third quarter. This keeps Kohl's on track to accomplish a $2 billion beauty business. New Downgrades Shortage of Labor and Supply Chain Challenges Ail Boeing (BA) Per the Zacks analyst, Boeing faces risks from labor shortages that could slow production, raise costs, and affect quality. Supply-chain issues and higher U.S. import tariffs add further pressure. Landstar (LSTR) Continues to Grapple With Weak Freight Market Per the Zacks analyst, weakness in overall volumes due to headwinds like weak freight demand, supply-chain woes and slower network velocity are hurting the top line. Macroeconomic Challenges, Intense Rivalry Ails Bruker (BRKR) The Zacks analyst is concerned with macroeconomic impacts, including global tariffs and U.S. academic funding headwinds, weighing on Bruker's operations. Competitive pressures may hurt its growth. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.
